        Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE-Advanced), formerly the
        Indian Institutes of Technology-Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE), is
        an academic examination held annually in India. It is conducted by one
        of the seven zonal IITs (IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT
        Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati) under the guidance of
        the Joint Admission Board (JAB). It is the sole prerequisite for
        <mark style="background-color: yellow"
          >admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology. Other
          universities—such as the Indian Institute of Petroleum and
          Energy(IIPE), the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, the
          IndianInstitute of Science Education and Research (IISERs), and the
          Indian Institute of Science</mark
        >
        —use the score obtained on the JEE-Advanced exam as the basis for
        admission. The JEE score is also used as a possible basis for admission
        by Indian applicants to non-Indian universities such as the University
        of Cambridge and National University of Singapore.
      </p>

      <p>
        The examination is organised each year by one of the IITs, on a
        round-robin rotation pattern. It has a very low qualification rate
        (about 9,369 in 479,651 in 2012; ~1.95%) The qualification rate of the
        JEE-Advanced in 2017 was approximately 0.92% (about 11,000 out of
        1,200,000 who applied for JEE Main).
      </p>
      <p>
        Only those top 1,20,000 students are selected from jee main exam for
        Advance

        The MHT-CET or Common Entrance Test is an annual entrance exam conducted
        by the Government of Maharashtra.It is conducted by the Directorate of
        Technical Education. The degree courses of the following streams are
        mainly accounted for in this entrance exam:Engineering and Pharmacy
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier the test scores were also used for admissions to Medical degree
        courses. After the Supreme Court of India insisted that only NEET can be
        used for undergraduate medicine admissions all over India, MHT-CET has
        been scrapped for medical colleges. The test is conducted in online mode
        for the first time in 2019. The State Common Entrance Test Cell,
        Maharashtra released the syllabus and marking scheme for the Computer
        Based Test (CBT).
